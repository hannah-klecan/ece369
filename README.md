5-stage pipelined MIPS processor 

Building a complete working processor that:
- Can execute real MIPS programs
- Runs on actual FPGA hardware
- Shows visible results on the displays

Pipelining 
- Allows multiple instructions to execute simultaneously (one in each stage)

Next Lab: Data Hazard Handling 
Data hazards: execution of one instruction is dependent on the results of another instruction
- Will add data hazard detection and forwarding
